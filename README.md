## Review-Carousel
**Created with Html, Css, Js**

I learned from this Challenge on [freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/javascript-projects-for-beginners/#how-to-create-a-review-carousel) how to create a carousel of reviews with a button that generates random reviews.

This is a good feature to have on an ecommerce site to display customer reviews or a personal portfolio to display client reviews.
